Hi,


This is my public repository for a coding test as part of a recruiting process. The idea is to write a program to solve a word puzzle. Given a start word i.e. same and an end word i.e. cost the application has to come up with a list of words that move from the start word to the end word by changing only one letter between any two words. Each intermediate step should be a real word from a dictionary file.
